MATE, YOU'RE HERE, WAS WONDERING WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG

COME ON, I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO PUT OUT FIRES THEN

OUR FIRE EXTINGUISHERS ARE OVER HERE.


THERES FOUR BASIC STEPS YOU GOTTA REMEMBER:

1. PULL OUT THE SAFETY PIN
2. AIM THE NOZZLE AT THE BASE OF THE FIRE, NOT IT'S FLAMES OR 
YOU'LL NEVER PUT IT OUT

3. SQUEEZE THE HANDLE 

4. SWEEP FROM SIDE TO SIDE


YOU SEE THESE LABELS ON THE EXTINGUISHERS? 

YOU GOTTA LOOK AT THEM. SEE WHICH ONE'S THE RIGHT ONE TO DEAL WITH THE FIRE YOU'RE FACING.

THIS ONE HERE? YELLOW - WET CHEMICAL, YOU CAN USE IT FOR COOKING OIL FIRES OR ON MATERIALS LIKE WOOD, PAPER, PLASTIC

THE BLUE ONE'S DRY POWDER, HANDLES ANY KIND OF FIRE.

IF IT'S ALL RED IT'S WATER - ONLY USE THIS ONE ON MATERIALS LIKE WOOD, PAPER AND PLASTIC -- YOU DON'T WANT TO USE IT ON ANYTHING ELSE, TRUST ME.


CO2 HERE CAN BE USED ON FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS AND LIVE ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT

BEIGE IS FOAM, YOU CAN USE IT ON FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS OR MATERIALS LIKE WOOD, PAPER, PLASTIC

AND THAT'S IT.


THE REST IS UP TO YOU.
